# Unfinished Modules/Tasks
 ## Comment System:
- haven’t built a way to add, moderate, or show comments.  

 ## Advanced AI Moderation:  

- only using regex for moderation, no AI or NLP yet, and moderate_content is just a placeholder.  

 ## Admin Dashboard Enhancements:  

- dashboard is basic, with no stats or moderation queue.  

 ## Optimized Recommendations:  

- ecommendations use simple cosine similarity, no advanced tools or content-based suggestions.  

 ## Autocomplete Enhancements:  

- Tag autocomplete is basic, no suggestions for post titles or content.  

 ## Testing and Validation:  

- have few automated tests and no unit tests for views, models, or moderation.  

 ## UI/UX Improvements:  

- The frontend and responsiveness need more work.  

 ## Deployment:
